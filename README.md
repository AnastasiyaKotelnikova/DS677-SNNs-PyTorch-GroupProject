Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) using PyTorch and the Norse library. The project explores neuromorphic computing and compares SNNs with traditional deep learning approaches.
 
This project explores Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) using PyTorch and the Norse library. SNNs are a biologically inspired class of neural networks that process information more efficiently by mimicking the way neurons communicate through discrete spikes. Our goal is to implement, train, and evaluate an SNN model and compare its performance with traditional deep learning approaches.

Objectives
- Implement an **SNN model** using PyTorch and Norse.
- Preprocess and use neuromorphic datasets (**SHD, N-MNIST, MNIST**).
- Compare the performance of **SNN vs. traditional ANN models**.
- Optimize and fine-tune SNN hyperparameters for better efficiency.
- Document results and findings for further research in neuromorphic computing.
