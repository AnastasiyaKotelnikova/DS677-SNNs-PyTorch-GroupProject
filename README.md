# Spiking Neural Networks with PyTorch & Norse

This repository contains the implementation of **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** using **PyTorch** and the **Norse** library.  
This project was **researched, proposed, and led by Anastasiya Kotelnikova and Mehrvish Mirza** as part of the **DS677 Deep Learning** course at NJIT.  
It explores **neuromorphic computing** by implementing biologically inspired models and comparing SNNs to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

## Project Overview

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a biologically inspired class of neural networks that simulate neuron behavior using discrete spikes for energy-efficient and event-driven processing.

This project focuses on building and evaluating SNNs using time-based datasets and benchmarking them against standard deep learning models.

## Objectives

-  Implement an **SNN model** using PyTorch and Norse  
-  Preprocess and use neuromorphic dataset: **SHD**
-  Compare performance of **SNNs vs. traditional ANNs**  
-  Optimize SNN hyperparameters for improved training accuracy and efficiency  
-  Document results and provide research insights into neuromorphic computing
